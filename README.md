Tribute page project from FreeCodeCamp.com

FreeCodeCamp has us use codepen for this project which I did earlier. This is not just a second draft but a second attempt at making my 
own tribute page for Dr. Norman Borlaug. 

Previously, I had a lot of trouble getting things to line up properly and formatted so this attempt I will work on perfecting the layout, font,
ect.
