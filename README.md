Tribute page project from FreeCodeCamp.com

FreeCodeCamp has us use codepen for this project which I did earlier. This is not just a second draft but a second attempt at making my 
own tribute page for Dr. Norman Borlaug. 

Previously, I had a lot of trouble getting things to line up properly and formatted so this attempt I will work on perfecting the layout, font,
ect. 

***FINAL DRAFT UPDATE***
This went MUCH better than last time. I really liked using the flexbox here. It took me a minute to get the div elements right and once
I did everything lined up nicely. 
I did snoop a bit and looked at some of the font properties from the source page (https:www.codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx) just
to make sure the syles matched.

On the 'tribute-info' list I struggled finding the exact formating so ended up just making it look like how I liked it best and stuck with
that. 

All in all, I am much happier with this version and glad I came back to re-do it. I feel like I am already coming out ahead and have really
only been at this for about a week. The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp are really great tools and if anyone ever reads this, I highly 
reccomend going through their programs!
